# Sound Effects

## ship-sink.mp3 (Optional)

The app will automatically play a sound effect when a ship is sunk.

**Currently**: A fallback Web Audio API beep will play if no file is found.

**To add a custom sound effect**:
1. Download a free sound from:
   - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/explosion/
   - https://freesound.org/search/?q=explosion
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/explosion/
   
2. Save the file as `ship-sink.mp3` in this directory
3. Recommended: 1-2 second explosion/dramatic sound effect
4. Redeploy the frontend

**Note**: The fallback beep works fine if you don't want to add a custom sound.
